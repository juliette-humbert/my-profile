			<h1>Hi everyone, I'm Juliette</h1>

			<h2>Horse-riding</h2>
			<p>
				Competitor, it is unthinkable for me to tire of this sport, transforming the most arrogant person to the most humble one, implying leadership, guts and falls.

			<h2>Events organization</h2>
			<p>
				Make people participating forget all the work behind an event because they enjoy too much is a goal in life that I want to reach. I like the pressure to remember the difficulty of each decisions, because an event implies coordination, communication and the smooth running of it.

			<h2>Music</h2>
			<p>
				Music is stronger than any memories, it is part of my daily life. Cultural exchanges have always been at the heart of our societies but they are regularly called into question thanks to its power.
